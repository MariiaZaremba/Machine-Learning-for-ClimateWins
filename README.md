# Machine-Learning-for-ClimateWins

# Objective
In this project, I’ll use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization.

# Introduction and Company Profile
Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data.

# Project Background
ClimateWins wants you to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.

# Here are the questions it wants to answer first:
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

# Data Sets
I’ll be using a data set based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for
almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
